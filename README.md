# FlareOn2020_Wednesday-3
In memory bot for flareon 2020 challenge #3. This challenge is a game written in NIM. This repository contains a marked up IDB, reversed structures using the tool https://github.com/ReClassNET/ReClass.NET, and a bot to beat the game.

This was made for a preview version of the game so the pointer here probably needs updated:
